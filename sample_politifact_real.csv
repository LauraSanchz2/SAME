1,politifact10185,if republicans capture control of u.s. senate there will be many explanations for their victory president obamas poor numbers great senate map filled with attractive opportunities generally strong slate of candidates success of establishment backed republicans in primaries and others. but one of biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with national political climate or really campaign as whole. five democrats all of whom are old enough to be eligible for medicare decided not to run for another term in senate. their decisions all announced before may 2013 are huge but largely forgotten boon to gop hopes. story continued below five retirements were max baucus of montana tom harkin of iowa tim johnson of south dakota carl levin of michigan and jay rockefeller of west virginia. sixth frank lautenberg of new jersey had announced his retirement but he later died sen. cory booker democrat now holds seat after special election last year. retirements present challenge for incumbent party because its easier for party to hold senate seat when incumbent runs for reelection. significantly easier. over past half century about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in general election were reelected. in open seats during same time period incumbent party held seat just about 60 percent of time. so not having incumbent in senate race substantially reduces odds of victory. importance of open seats to gop senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of partys recent inability to defeat democratic incumbents. in 1980 republicans beat eye popping nine democratic incumbents on election day to capture control of senate for first time in quarter century. since then gop has not defeated more than two democratic senate incumbents in any general election. partys best recent senate years 1994 and 2010 were built largely on winning open seats six in 1994 and four in 2010. democrats meanwhile have had more success they beat seven and six incumbent republicans respectively in recapturing upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. latter year 2006 was notable in that democrats did not capture single open seat in netting six seats they needed to eke out narrow 51 49 senate edge. republicans seem likely to beat more than two democratic senate incumbents this november for first time in almost 35 years sens. mark begich of alaska mary landrieu of louisiana and mark pryor of arkansas all have less than 50 50 odds of winning according to university of virginia center for politics crystal ball ratings which i help formulate. sen. mark udall of colorado is right at 50 50 and sens. kay hagan of north carolina and jeanne shaheen of new hampshire are both in tough races too. but in all likelihood foundation for this years gop gains will be built on winning open seats. that s why democratic exits loom so large in upcoming election. election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different there would probably be more competitive races and democrats would have greater number of redoubts to hold off republican advance. lets assume for purposes of this what if exercise that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection which is of course big assumption for group whose average age is 74 years old west virginia rockefeller might still be underdog to rep. shelley moore capito r who entered race before incumbent retired. but that race would have been much closer presumably than capitos largely sleepy contest against west virginia secretary of state natalie tennant and national republican senatorial committee would not have been able to just take pass on race as it has this cycle. capitos strong performance as candidate is often overlooked bright spot for republicans this cycle she s done so well in state where gop has nt won senate seat in more than half century that race never became obviously competitive but running in open seat has made her job easier. crystal ball rating here is safe republican with rockefeller in race we d probably rate it just leans republican or maybe toss up. few polls before rockefeller retired suggested capito would have started race with narrow lead and rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro coal in recent years political problem in state where coal is still king. montana baucus like rockefeller would have been in for very tough race in 2014 if he had run. democratic polling firm public policy polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against rep. steve daines who eventually became gop nominee. baucus announced his retirement in april 2013 and then later resigned to become ambassador to china. gov. steve bullock appointed then lt. gov. john walsh fellow democrat to fill vacancy. walshs campaign of course fell apart over summer under weight of plagiarism. now democrats are stuck with little known nominee amanda curtis state representative and daines is huge favorite. kyle kondik is managing editor of sabatos crystal ball nonpartisan political newsletter produced by university of virginia center for politics. he also directs centers washington d.c. office. ,opinion how five key retirements changed 2014 midterms. max baucus jay rockefeller tom harkin tim johnson politics carl levin. ,@politico actually we will thank them .. @@@well not to get too into semantics but i liked tweet rather than rting it. pretty modest if not inconsequential signal boost. we 're not them may not be winning strategy but it 's absolutely consequential. unfortunately strategic voting is necessitated by fptp. @@@@@@@usrealitycheck really. it 's fault of 5 people. how about taking responsibility failed policy and ability as whole party. u abused it. @@@thanks steve !. @@@@politico @politicomag why voters should prefer democrats over gop nov 4...http://bettertimesaheadaprilfool.com/agenda_for_usa_greatness.html. @@@which ideas are terrible ones equality. justice. broad distribution of power. @@@so does that mean putin helped trump win election or did he help hilary help trump win election. maybe dems just had deep state to help republicans pass tax plan to give that lady extra 1.50 week. what f .... @@@whatever helps you to fall asleep at night ... lol. @@@i think pa showed up. have to remember lamb out spent his opponent out canvased his opponent in district and still only won by 100 votes. also in nov. all of this will be replay with reassignment of district map. 2018 mid terms will be more telling then this was. @@@hey there 's also chance they 'll win due to other candidate also being terrible and feel completely justified. @@@i am republican. country before party. better dem than dotard. voted blue for first time this week. so did my lifetime republican parents. we will take back this country and if i have vote blue to keep it safe so fucking be it. @@@i hope you are clairvoyant !. @@@
